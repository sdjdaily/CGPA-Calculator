# CGPA-Calculator
Integrating a CGPA calculator within a college website

I have an amateur Java code which takes in grade points and total credits for each individual subject and returns the GPA.

Integrating this code to a college website will be helpful for students in knowing their GPA/CGPA without getting their brains tangled up.

Will be glad to learn how to improve my code, and integrating this functionality in a college website.

Assemble college DEVS!
